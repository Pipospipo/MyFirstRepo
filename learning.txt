What I have learned from this course

yo 
I have learned to connect using ssh 
clone the repo and do my edits then push to github 
tried a couple of commands though i don't remember most of them 
I forgot to type a commit message on github so i had to add it using git 
git commit --amend -m "your new commit message"
git push --force yourrepo
